# WebGL Shaders

Live Demo: https://shores.design/index.php/webgl-shaders/

This is a collection of fragment shaders that I wrote on the website shadertoy.com to learn and share from the community there. All of this is my own work, but I of course built on the concepts presented by others. Many of these shaders utilize raymarched scenes, signed distance field (SDF) geometies (including triply-periodic minimal surface - TPMS - structures), and many classic graphics programming tools and tricks.

The collection is also a practice in WebGL. Although a simple example requiring an absolute minimal vertex shader, it is somewhat complex in requiring the production and management of multiple webGL programs, one for each fragment shader. Uniforms and such must update correctly for all, or at least whichever one is in use.

As a fun extra, I have challenged myself to write this page as a single file with no imports. I'll state here that this is a coding challenge, and absolutely not how I would write any significant software program! Being all in one HTML file is essential for easy displaying on my website, and I think it makes it nice and compact (though quite cluttered).
